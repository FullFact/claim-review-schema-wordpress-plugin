Implement Claim Review Schema on sites to allow fact-checking organisations to implement claim revew schema on their sites.

== Description ==

The Claim Review Schema is a Schema led by [The Claim Review Project](https://www.claimreviewproject.com/) that allows fact checking organisations to tag their articles in such a way that allows sites such as Google, Facebook, Bing & Youtube to analyse the article and structure the data accordingly in their indexes.

This plugin, created by an independent UK Fact Checking Charity [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/), allows fact checkers to quickly and easily fill in a few details about the fact checking article, and implement schema.
