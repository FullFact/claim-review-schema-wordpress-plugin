Implements Claim Review Schema on sites, mainly to allow fact checking organisations to structure their fact checks in machine readable ways.

== Description ==

Claim Review Schema is a Schema led by an international consortium of fact checkers. It allows fact checking organisations to tag their articles in such a way that allows third parties such as Google, Facebook, Bing & Youtube to analyse and sort the fact checking data accordingly in their indexes.

This plugin was created by an independent UK Fact Checking Charity [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/), it allows fact checkers to quickly and easily fill in the details needed for claim review schema, and adds it onto every single article that is published.

This plugin was built on a server with PHP 7.0 running. It has been tested on a PHP 5.6 server and it works as intended, however we'd recommend that it's run on a server with a minimum of PHP 7.0. Support will only be provided with servers that run a minimum of PHP 7.0, as it becomes hard to maintain. For instructions on how to upgrade PHP to 7.0, [please read this guide from WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/).

== Installation ==

To install the plugin, do the following.

1. Visit the plugins page from your WordPress Dashboard and select "Add New".

6. Go to any post of the post type that you set for the Display Settings and add your Schema details.
7. Once you publish the post, the schema will be published too.
